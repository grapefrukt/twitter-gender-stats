This is a small tool that will pull all the users you are following on twitter
and guess their gender. 

It will respect he/him, she/her or they/them tags in a users description, if 
no such data is available it will guess according to a dataset provided by the 
OpenGenderTracking project. 

Each user is assigned a value from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0 is female and 1.0 is male.

If a user has specified their preferred pronouns in their description, this value
is used. If not, the probability of their pronoun being either gender is used.

This means that a user named Aamari will be scored as approximately 0.55, meaning
slightly more likely to be male. 

Once all users have been guessed, the scores are summarized and averaged. 

This hopefully gives somewhat better data than simply picking male/female/neither 
for each name.
